          Apart from being a mobile app developer, I enjoy most of my time being
          outdoors.Spend quality time with friends and family. short trips with
          friends. Spend evenings in the beaches. Read books and engage in
          useful discussions and conversations.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre
          movies and television shows, and I spend a large amount of my free
          time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web
          development world.
